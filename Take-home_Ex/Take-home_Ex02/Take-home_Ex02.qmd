[Analyzing Singapore’s International Trade: Trends, Visualization Enhancements, and Time-Series Insights]{style="font-size: 44px; font-weight: bold;"}

# Introduction

Global trade has undergone significant transformations in recent years, particularly since 2015, influenced by geopolitical events, economic policies, and shifting trade agreements. This analysis explores Singapore’s international trade trends by examining Merchandise Trade by Region/Market data from the Department of Statistics Singapore (DOS).

The objectives of this study are as follows:

1.  Critique & Improve Trade Visualizations – Analyze three existing trade-related visualizations, assess their strengths and weaknesses, and propose enhanced designs.

2.  Develop Data-Driven Visual Insights – Utilize R and ggplot2 to recreate the selected visualizations, ensuring a more effective presentation of trade patterns.

3.  Perform Time-Series Analysis – Apply statistical methods to identify trade trends and forecast future movements using time-series models.

This study enhances the clarity and effectiveness of trade data visualization, leveraging data analytics techniques to uncover meaningful patterns in Singapore’s international trade.

# Download and Prepare the Data

## The Pros

Clear structure & intuitive layout

-   The use of stacked bars for each year, with exports and imports distinguished by color, makes it easy to compare trends across years.

-   The total trade value is prominently displayed for each year, reinforcing key takeaways.

Effective color differentiation

-   Different colors are used for exports and imports, which helps distinguish between the two.

-   The use of pastel shades prevents visual clutter while maintaining clarity.

Good use of labels and alignment

-   Each bar is labeled with the exact trade value, avoiding the need for readers to estimate values.

-   The numbers are aligned well with the bars, reducing ambiguity.

Key insights highlighted

-   The 6.6% increase in total trade for 2024 is clearly emphasized, making it easy for viewers to grasp the key trend.

-   The visual design incorporates icons (e.g., money bag for increase in trade), which adds an engaging element.

### The Cons

Lack of percentage growth for individual components

-   The chart mentions an overall 6.6% increase, but it does not show how much exports vs. imports changed separately.

-   A breakdown of year-over-year percentage growth for exports and imports would provide more useful insights.

Stacked bar charts can be misleading

-   While stacked bars show the total trade amount, they do not effectively convey the individual growth or decline trends in exports vs. imports over time.

-   A side-by-side bar chart or a line graph might better illustrate how exports and imports change independently rather than being part of a total sum.
