It breaks graphs into semantic components like scales and layers and is based on two principles:\n\nGraphics as layers of grammatical elements.\nCreating meaningful plots through aesthetic mapping.\n\nThis approach helps to understand complex graphics, uncover unexpected connections, and establish a foundation for diverse visualizations. While it guides the creation of well-formed graphics, some grammatically correct visuals may still lack meaningful insights.\n\n\nggplot2 is an implementation of Leland Wilkinson’s Grammar of Graphics, as detailed by Hadley Wickham (2010). It comprises seven key building blocks:\n\n\n\n\nReference: Hadley Wickham (2010) “A layered grammar of graphics.” Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, vol. 19, no. 1, pp. 3–28.\n\n\n\nData: The dataset being visualized.\nAesthetics: Attributes of data mapped to visual properties like position, color, size, shape, or transparency.\nGeometries: Visual elements representing data (e.g., points, bars, lines).\nFacets: Subset the data to create multiple variations of the graph (paneling).\nStatistics: Transformations summarizing data (e.g., mean, confidence intervals).\nCoordinate Systems: Define the plane for mapping data on the graphic.\nThemes: Adjust non-data components, such as titles, axes labels, and legend styles.\n\n\n\n\n\nAesthetic mappings in ggplot2 link data attributes to visual characteristics like position, color, size, shape, or transparency, enabling the visualization to convey information. Aesthetics are specified using the aes() function, and each geom layer can have its own aes settings. This allows for flexible and informative plotting.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeometric objects are the actual marks we put on a plot. Examples include:\n\ngeom_point for drawing individual points (e.g., a scatter plot)\ngeom_line for drawing lines (e.g., for a line charts)\ngeom_smooth for drawing smoothed lines (e.g., for simple trends or approximations)\ngeom_bar for drawing bars (e.g., for bar charts)\ngeom_histogram for drawing binned values (e.g. a histogram)\ngeom_polygon for drawing arbitrary shapes\ngeom_map for drawing polygons in the shape of a map! (You can access the data to use for these maps by using the map_data() function).\n\n\n\n\nCollection of Geometry Shapes\n\n\n\nA plot must have at least one geom; there is no upper limit. You can add a geom to a plot using the + operator.\nFor complete list, please refer to here.\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below plots a bar chart by using geom_bar().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a dot plot, each dot represents one observation, and the dot’s width corresponds to the bin width or maximum width (based on the binning algorithm).

It visualises five summary statistics (the median, two hinges and two whiskers), and all “outlying” points individually.\nThe code chunk below plots boxplots by using geom_boxplot().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS,       \n           x= GENDER)) +    \n  geom_boxplot()            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotches are used in box plots to help visually assess whether the medians of distributions differ. If the notches do not overlap, this is evidence that the medians are different.\nThe code chunk below plots the distribution of Maths scores by gender in notched plot instead of boxplot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_violin is designed for creating violin plot. Violin plots are a way of comparing multiple data distributions. With ordinary density curves, it is difficult to compare more than just a few distributions because the lines visually interfere with each other. With a violin plot, it’s easier to compare several distributions since they’re placed side by side.\nThe code below plot the distribution of Maths score by gender in violin plot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_violin()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_point() is especially useful for creating scatterplot.\nThe code chunk below plots a scatterplot showing the Maths and English grades of pupils by using geom_point().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point()            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below plots the data points on the boxplots by using both geom_boxplot() and geom_point().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +                    \n  geom_point(position=\"jitter\", \n             size = 0.5)        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Statistics functions statistically transform data, usually as some form of summary. For example:\n\nfrequency of values of a variable (bar graph)\n\na mean\na confidence limit\n\nThere are two ways to use these functions:\n\nadd a stat_() function and override the default geom, or\nadd a geom_() function and override the default stat.\n\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below adds mean values by using stat_summary() function and overriding the default geom.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  stat_summary(geom = \"point\",       \n               fun = \"mean\",         \n               colour =\"red\",        \n               size=4)               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below adding mean values by using geom_() function and overriding the default stat.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  geom_point(stat=\"summary\",        \n             fun=\"mean\",           \n             colour=\"red\",          \n             size=4)          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scatterplot below shows the relationship of Maths and English grades of pupils. The interpretability of this graph can be improved by adding a best fit curve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, geom_smooth() is used to plot a best fit curve on the scatterplot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(size=0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nThe default method used is loess.\n\n\n\nThe default smoothing method can be overridden as shown below.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              linewidth=0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacetting generates small multiples (sometimes also called trellis plot), each displaying a different subset of the data. They are an alternative to aesthetics for displaying additional discrete variables. ggplot2 supports two types of factes, namely: facet_grid and facet_wrap.\n\n\nfacet_wrap wraps a 1d sequence of panels into 2d. This is generally a better use of screen space than facet_grid because most displays are roughly rectangular.\nThe code chunk below plots a trellis plot using facet-wrap().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20) +\n    facet_wrap(~ CLASS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfacet_grid() forms a matrix of panels defined by row and column facetting variables. It is most useful when you have two discrete variables, and all combinations of the variables exist in the data.\nThe code chunk below plots a trellis plot using facet_grid().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20) +\n    facet_grid(~ CLASS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coordinates functions map the position of objects onto the plane of the plot. There are a number of different possible coordinate systems to use, they are:\n\ncoord_cartesian(): the default cartesian coordinate systems, where you specify x and y values (e.g. allows you to zoom in or out).\ncoord_flip(): a cartesian system with the x and y flipped.\ncoord_fixed(): a cartesian system with a “fixed” aspect ratio (e.g. 1.78 for a “widescreen” plot).\ncoord_quickmap(): a coordinate system that approximates a good aspect ratio for maps.\n\n\n\nBy the default, the bar chart of ggplot2 is in vertical form.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below flips the horizontal bar chart into vertical bar chart by using coord_flip().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scatterplot on the right is slightly misleading because the y-aixs and x-axis range are not equal.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, size=0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below fixed both the y-axis and x-axis range from 0-100.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              size=0.5) +  \n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThemes control elements of the graph not related to the data. For example:\n\nbackground colour\nsize of fonts\ngridlines\ncolour of labels\n\nBuilt-in themes include: - theme_gray() (default) - theme_bw() - theme_classic()\nA list of theme can be found at this link. Each theme element can be conceived of as either a line (e.g. x-axis), a rectangle (e.g. graph background), or text (e.g. axis title).\n\n\nThe code chunk below plot a horizontal bar chart using theme_gray().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_gray()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA horizontal bar chart plotted using theme_classic().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA horizontal bar chart plotted using theme_minimal().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHadley Wickham (2023) ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis.

If the notches do not overlap, this is evidence that the medians are different.\nThe code chunk below plots the distribution of Maths scores by gender in notched plot instead of boxplot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_violin is designed for creating violin plot. Violin plots are a way of comparing multiple data distributions. With ordinary density curves, it is difficult to compare more than just a few distributions because the lines visually interfere with each other. With a violin plot, it’s easier to compare several distributions since they’re placed side by side.\nThe code below plot the distribution of Maths score by gender in violin plot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_violin()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_point() is especially useful for creating scatterplot.\nThe code chunk below plots a scatterplot showing the Maths and English grades of pupils by using geom_point().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point()            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below plots the data points on the boxplots by using both geom_boxplot() and geom_point().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +                    \n  geom_point(position=\"jitter\", \n             size = 0.5)"

    "text": "In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to create interactive data visualisation by using functions provided by ggiraph and plotlyr packages.\n\n\n\nFirst, write a code chunk to check, install and launch the following R packages:\n\nggiraph for making ‘ggplot’ graphics interactive.\nplotly, R library for plotting interactive statistical graphs.\nDT provides an R interface to the JavaScript library DataTables that create interactive table on html page.\ntidyverse, a family of modern R packages specially designed to support data science, analysis and communication task including creating static statistical graphs.\npatchwork for combining multiple ggplot2 graphs into one figure.\n\nThe code chunk below will be used to accomplish the task.\n\npacman::p_load(ggiraph, plotly, \n               patchwork, DT, tidyverse) \n\n\n\n\nIn this section, Exam_data.csv provided will be used. Using read_csv of readr package, import Exam_data.csv into R.\nThe code chunk below read_csv of readr package is used to import Exam_data.csv data file into R and save it as an tibble data frame called exam_data.\n\nexam_data &lt;- read_csv(\"../data/Exam_data.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nggiraph  is an htmlwidget and a ggplot2 extension. It allows ggplot graphics to be interactive.\nInteractive is made with ggplot geometries that can understand three arguments:\n\nTooltip a column of data-sets that contain tooltips to be displayed when the mouse is over elements.\nOnclick a column of data-sets that contain a JavaScript function to be executed when elements are clicked.\nData_id a column of data-sets that contain an id to be associated with elements.\n\nIf it used within a shiny application, elements associated with an id (data_id) can be selected and manipulated on client and server sides. Refer to this article for more detail explanation.\n\n\nBelow shows a typical code chunk to plot an interactive statistical graph by using ggiraph package. Notice that the code chunk consists of two parts. First, an ggplot object will be created. Next, girafe() of ggiraph will be used to create an interactive svg object.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = ID),\n    stackgroups = TRUE, \n    binwidth = 1, \n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL, \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 6*0.618\n)\n\nNotice that two steps are involved. First, an interactive version of ggplot2 geom (i.e. geom_dotplot_interactive) will be used to create the basic graph.

Different from other plotly platform, plot.R is free and open source.\n\nThere are two ways to create interactive graph by using plotly, they are:\n\nby using plot_ly(), and\nby using ggplotly()\n\n\n\nThe tabset below shows an example a basic interactive plot created by using plot_ly().\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot_ly(data = exam_data, \n             x = ~MATHS, \n             y = ~ENGLISH)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, color argument is mapped to a qualitative visual variable (i.e. RACE).\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive:\n\nClick on the colour symbol at the legend.\n\n\n\n\nplot_ly(data = exam_data, \n             x = ~MATHS, \n             y = ~ENGLISH,\n             color = ~RACE)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below plots an interactive scatter plot by using ggplotly().\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n            aes(x = MATHS,\n                y = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\nggplotly(p)\n\n\n)\n\nNotice that the only extra line you need to include in the code chunk is ggplotly().\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe creation of a coordinated linked plot by using plotly involves three steps:\n\nhighlight_key() of plotly package is used as shared data.\ntwo scatterplots will be created by using ggplot2 functions.\nlastly, subplot() of plotly package is used to place them next to each other side-by-side.\n\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on a data point of one of the scatterplot and see how the corresponding point on the other scatterplot is selected.\n\n\n\nd &lt;- highlight_key(exam_data)\np1 &lt;- ggplot(data=d, \n            aes(x = MATHS,\n                y = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(data=d, \n            aes(x = MATHS,\n                y = SCIENCE)) +\n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\nsubplot(ggplotly(p1),\n        ggplotly(p2))\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk:\n\nhighlight_key() simply creates an object of class crosstalk::SharedData.\nVisit this link to learn more about crosstalk.\n\n\n\n\n\nCrosstalk is an add-on to the htmlwidgets package. It extends htmlwidgets with a set of classes, functions, and conventions for implementing cross-widget interactions (currently, linked brushing and filtering).\n\n\n\nA wrapper of the JavaScript Library DataTables\nData objects in R can be rendered as HTML tables using the JavaScript library ‘DataTables’ (typically via R Markdown or Shiny).\n\n\nDT::datatable(exam_data, class= \"compact\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on a data point of one of the scatterplot and see how the corresponding point on the other scatterplot is selected.\n\n\nCode chunk below is used to implement the coordinated brushing shown above.\n\nd &lt;- highlight_key(exam_data) \np &lt;- ggplot(d, \n            aes(ENGLISH, \n                MATHS)) + \n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\n\ngg &lt;- highlight(ggplotly(p),        \n                \"plotly_selected\")  \n\ncrosstalk::bscols(gg,               \n                  DT::datatable(d), \n                  widths = 5)        \n\n)\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk:\n\nhighlight() is a function of plotly package. It sets a variety of options for brushing (i.e., highlighting) multiple plots. These options are primarily designed for linking multiple plotly graphs, and may not behave as expected when linking plotly to another htmlwidget package via crosstalk. In some cases, other htmlwidgets will respect these options, such as persistent selection in leaflet.\nbscols() is a helper function of crosstalk package. It makes it easy to put HTML elements side by side. It can be called directly from the console but is especially designed to work in an R Markdown document.

    "text": "When telling a visually-driven data story, animated graphics tends to attract the interest of the audience and make deeper impression than static graphics. In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to create animated data visualisation by using gganimate and plotly r packages. At the same time, you will also learn how to (i) reshape data by using tidyr package, and (ii) process, wrangle and transform data by using dplyr package.\n\n\nWhen creating animations, the plot does not actually move. Instead, many individual plots are built and then stitched together as movie frames, just like an old-school flip book or cartoon. Each frame is a different plot when conveying motion, which is built using some relevant subset of the aggregate data. The subset drives the flow of the animation when stitched back together.\n\n\n\n\nBefore we dive into the steps for creating an animated statistical graph, it’s important to understand some of the key concepts and terminology related to this type of visualization.\n\nFrame: In an animated line graph, each frame represents a different point in time or a different category. When the frame changes, the data points on the graph are updated to reflect the new data.\nAnimation Attributes: The animation attributes are the settings that control how the animation behaves. For example, you can specify the duration of each frame, the easing function used to transition between frames, and whether to start the animation from the current frame or from the beginning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBefore you start making animated graphs, you should first ask yourself: Does it makes sense to go through the effort? If you are conducting an exploratory data analysis, a animated graphic may not be worth the time investment. However, if you are giving a presentation, a few well-placed animated graphics can help an audience connect with your topic remarkably better than static counterparts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, write a code chunk to check, install and load the following R packages:\n\nplotly, R library for plotting interactive statistical graphs.\ngganimate, an ggplot extension for creating animated statistical graphs.\ngifski converts video frames to GIF animations using pngquant’s fancy features for efficient cross-frame palettes and temporal dithering. It produces animated GIFs that use thousands of colors per frame.\ngapminder: An excerpt of the data available at Gapminder.org. We just want to use its country_colors scheme.\ntidyverse, a family of modern R packages specially designed to support data science, analysis and communication task including creating static statistical graphs.\n\n\npacman::p_load(readxl, gifski, gapminder,\n               plotly, gganimate, tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, the Data worksheet from GlobalPopulation Excel workbook will be used.\nWrite a code chunk to import Data worksheet from GlobalPopulation Excel workbook by using appropriate R package from tidyverse family.\n\ncol &lt;- c(\"Country\", \"Continent\")\nglobalPop &lt;- read_xls(\"../data/GlobalPopulation.xls\",\n                      sheet=\"Data\") %&gt;%\n  mutate_each_(funs(factor(.)), col) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above\n\n\n\n\nread_xls() of readxl package is used to import the Excel worksheet.\nmutate_each_() of dplyr package is used to convert all character data type into factor.\nmutate of dplyr package is used to convert data values of Year field into integer.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, mutate_each_() was deprecated in dplyr 0.7.0. and funs() was deprecated in dplyr 0.8.0. In view of this, we will re-write the code by using mutate_at() as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ncol &lt;- c(\"Country\", \"Continent\")\nglobalPop &lt;- read_xls(\"../data/GlobalPopulation.xls\",\n                      sheet=\"Data\") %&gt;%\n  mutate_at(col, as.factor) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))\n\nInstead of using mutate_at(), across() can be used to derive the same outputs.\n\ncol &lt;- c(\"Country\", \"Continent\")\nglobalPop &lt;- read_xls(\"../data/GlobalPopulation.xls\",\n                      sheet=\"Data\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(col, as.factor)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))\n\n\n\n\n\ngganimate extends the grammar of graphics as implemented by ggplot2 to include the description of animation.

    "text": "When telling a visually-driven data story, animated graphics tends to attract the interest of the audience and make deeper impression than static graphics. In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to create animated data visualisation by using gganimate and plotly r packages. At the same time, you will also learn how to (i) reshape data by using tidyr package, and (ii) process, wrangle and transform data by using dplyr package.\n\n\nWhen creating animations, the plot does not actually move. Instead, many individual plots are built and then stitched together as movie frames, just like an old-school flip book or cartoon. Each frame is a different plot when conveying motion, which is built using some relevant subset of the aggregate data. The subset drives the flow of the animation when stitched back together.\n\n\n\n\nBefore we dive into the steps for creating an animated statistical graph, it’s important to understand some of the key concepts and terminology related to this type of visualization.\n\nFrame: In an animated line graph, each frame represents a different point in time or a different category. When the frame changes, the data points on the graph are updated to reflect the new data.\nAnimation Attributes: The animation attributes are the settings that control how the animation behaves. For example, you can specify the duration of each frame, the easing function used to transition between frames, and whether to start the animation from the current frame or from the beginning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBefore you start making animated graphs, you should first ask yourself: Does it makes sense to go through the effort? If you are conducting an exploratory data analysis, a animated graphic may not be worth the time investment. However, if you are giving a presentation, a few well-placed animated graphics can help an audience connect with your topic remarkably better than static counterparts."

It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories.\nThat’s because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.\nWhen we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as B10.

    "text": "Visualising distribution is not new in statistical analysis. In chapter 1 we have shared with you some of the popular statistical graphics methods for visualising distribution are histogram, probability density curve (pdf), boxplot, notch plot and violin plot and how they can be created by using ggplot2. In this chapter, we are going to share with you two relatively new statistical graphic methods for visualising distribution, namely ridgeline plot and raincloud plot by using ggplot2 and its extensions.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the purpose of this exercise, the following R packages will be used, they are:\n\nggridges, a ggplot2 extension specially designed for plotting ridgeline plots,\nggdist, a ggplot2 extension spacially desgin for visualising distribution and uncertainty,\ntidyverse, a family of R packages to meet the modern data science and visual communication needs,\nggthemes, a ggplot extension that provides the user additional themes, scales, and geoms for the ggplots package, and\ncolorspace, an R package provides a broad toolbox for selecting individual colors or color palettes, manipulating these colors, and employing them in various kinds of visualisations.\n\nThe code chunk below will be used load these R packages into RStudio environment.\n\npacman::p_load(ggdist, ggridges, ggthemes,\n               colorspace, tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the purpose of this exercise, Exam_data.csv will be used.\nIn the code chunk below, read_csv() of readr package is used to import Exam_data.csv into R and saved it into a tibble data.frame.\n\nexam &lt;- read_csv(\"../data/Exam_data.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nRidgeline plot (sometimes called Joyplot) is a data visualisation technique for revealing the distribution of a numeric value for several groups. Distribution can be represented using histograms or density plots, all aligned to the same horizontal scale and presented with a slight overlap.\nFigure below is a ridgelines plot showing the distribution of English score by class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nRidgeline plots make sense when the number of group to represent is medium to high, and thus a classic window separation would take to much space. Indeed, the fact that groups overlap each other allows to use space more efficiently. If you have less than 5 groups, dealing with other distribution plots is probably better.\nIt works well when there is a clear pattern in the result, like if there is an obvious ranking in groups. Otherwise group will tend to overlap each other, leading to a messy plot not providing any insight.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are several ways to plot ridgeline plot with R. In this section, you will learn how to plot ridgeline plot by using ggridges package.\nggridges package provides two main geom to plot gridgeline plots, they are: geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(). The former takes height values directly to draw the ridgelines, and the latter first estimates data densities and then draws those using ridgelines.\nThe ridgeline plot below is plotted by using geom_density_ridges().\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    bandwidth = 3.4,\n    fill = lighten(\"#7097BB\", .3),\n    color = \"white\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0, 0)\n    ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes we would like to have the area under a ridgeline not filled with a single solid color but rather with colors that vary in some form along the x axis. This effect can be achieved by using either geom_ridgeline_gradient() or geom_density_ridges_gradient(). Both geoms work just like geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(), except that they allow for varying fill colors. However, they do not allow for alpha transparency in the fill. For technical reasons, we can have changing fill colors or transparency but not both.\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS,\n           fill = stat(x))) +\n  geom_density_ridges_gradient(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Temp.

It gets the name because the density plot is in the shape of a “raincloud”. The raincloud (half-density) plot enhances the traditional box-plot by highlighting multiple modalities (an indicator that groups may exist). The boxplot does not show where densities are clustered, but the raincloud plot does!\nIn this section, you will learn how to create a raincloud plot to visualise the distribution of English score by race. It will be created by using functions provided by ggdist and ggplot2 packages.\n\n\nFirst, we will plot a Half-Eye graph by using stat_halfeye() of ggdist package.\nThis produces a Half Eye visualization, which is contains a half-density and a slab-interval.\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above\n\n\n\nWe remove the slab interval by setting .width = 0 and point_colour = NA.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will add the third geometry layer using stat_dots() of ggdist package.

    "text": "Ridgeline plot (sometimes called Joyplot) is a data visualisation technique for revealing the distribution of a numeric value for several groups. Distribution can be represented using histograms or density plots, all aligned to the same horizontal scale and presented with a slight overlap.\nFigure below is a ridgelines plot showing the distribution of English score by class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nRidgeline plots make sense when the number of group to represent is medium to high, and thus a classic window separation would take to much space. Indeed, the fact that groups overlap each other allows to use space more efficiently. If you have less than 5 groups, dealing with other distribution plots is probably better.\nIt works well when there is a clear pattern in the result, like if there is an obvious ranking in groups. Otherwise group will tend to overlap each other, leading to a messy plot not providing any insight.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are several ways to plot ridgeline plot with R. In this section, you will learn how to plot ridgeline plot by using ggridges package.\nggridges package provides two main geom to plot gridgeline plots, they are: geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(). The former takes height values directly to draw the ridgelines, and the latter first estimates data densities and then draws those using ridgelines.\nThe ridgeline plot below is plotted by using geom_density_ridges().\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    bandwidth = 3.4,\n    fill = lighten(\"#7097BB\", .3),\n    color = \"white\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0, 0)\n    ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes we would like to have the area under a ridgeline not filled with a single solid color but rather with colors that vary in some form along the x axis. This effect can be achieved by using either geom_ridgeline_gradient() or geom_density_ridges_gradient(). Both geoms work just like geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(), except that they allow for varying fill colors. However, they do not allow for alpha transparency in the fill. For technical reasons, we can have changing fill colors or transparency but not both.\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS,\n           fill = stat(x))) +\n  geom_density_ridges_gradient(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Temp.

    "text": "Raincloud Plot is a data visualisation techniques that produces a half-density to a distribution plot. It gets the name because the density plot is in the shape of a “raincloud”. The raincloud (half-density) plot enhances the traditional box-plot by highlighting multiple modalities (an indicator that groups may exist). The boxplot does not show where densities are clustered, but the raincloud plot does!\nIn this section, you will learn how to create a raincloud plot to visualise the distribution of English score by race. It will be created by using functions provided by ggdist and ggplot2 packages.\n\n\nFirst, we will plot a Half-Eye graph by using stat_halfeye() of ggdist package.\nThis produces a Half Eye visualization, which is contains a half-density and a slab-interval.\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above\n\n\n\nWe remove the slab interval by setting .width = 0 and point_colour = NA.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will add the third geometry layer using stat_dots() of ggdist package.
