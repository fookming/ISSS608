Otherwise pacman will install the it automatically.\n\npacman::p_load(tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\n\nexam_data &lt;- read_csv('data/Exam_data.csv')\n\n\n\n\n is an R package for declaratively creating data-driven graphics based on The Grammar of Graphics.\nGrammar of Graphics\n\nIt is also part of the tidyverse family specially designed for visual exploration and communication.\n\n\nFor more detail, visit ggplot2 link.\n\n\n\nFirst, let us compare how R Graphics, the core graphical functions of Base R and ggplot plot a simple histogram.\n\nBase R Histogramggplot\n\n\n\n# Base R histogram\nhist(exam_data$MATHS,\n     main = \"Histogram of exam_data$MATHS\",\n     xlab = \"exam_data$MATHS\",\n     col = \"gray\",\n     border = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# ggplot2 histogram\nggplot(exam_data, aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = \"gray\", color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"ggplot2: Histogram of exam_data$MATHS\", x = \"exam_data$MATHS\", y = \"Frequency\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see that the code chunk is relatively simple if R Graphics is used. Then, the question is why ggplot2 is recommended?\nAs pointed out by Hadley Wickham\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe transferable skills from ggplot2 are not the idiosyncrasies of plotting syntax, but a powerful way of thinking about visualisation, as a way of mapping between variables and the visual properties of geometric objects that you can perceive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Grammar of Graphics, introduced by Leland Wilkinson (1999), is a framework for data visualization that defines how to structure mathematical and aesthetic elements into meaningful graphs. It breaks graphs into semantic components like scales and layers and is based on two principles:\n\nGraphics as layers of grammatical elements.\nCreating meaningful plots through aesthetic mapping.\n\nThis approach helps to understand complex graphics, uncover unexpected connections, and establish a foundation for diverse visualizations. While it guides the creation of well-formed graphics, some grammatically correct visuals may still lack meaningful insights.\n\n\nggplot2 is an implementation of Leland Wilkinson’s Grammar of Graphics, as detailed by Hadley Wickham (2010). It comprises seven key building blocks:\n\n\n\n\nReference: Hadley Wickham (2010) “A layered grammar of graphics.” Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, vol. 19, no. 1, pp. 3–28.\n\n\n\nData: The dataset being visualized.\nAesthetics: Attributes of data mapped to visual properties like position, color, size, shape, or transparency.\nGeometries: Visual elements representing data (e.g., points, bars, lines).\nFacets: Subset the data to create multiple variations of the graph (paneling).\nStatistics: Transformations summarizing data (e.g., mean, confidence intervals).\nCoordinate Systems: Define the plane for mapping data on the graphic.\nThemes: Adjust non-data components, such as titles, axes labels, and legend styles.\n\n\n\n\n\nAesthetic mappings in ggplot2 link data attributes to visual characteristics like position, color, size, shape, or transparency, enabling the visualization to convey information. Aesthetics are specified using the aes() function, and each geom layer can have its own aes settings. This allows for flexible and informative plotting.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeometric objects are the actual marks we put on a plot. Examples include:\n\ngeom_point for drawing individual points (e.g., a scatter plot)\ngeom_line for drawing lines (e.g., for a line charts)\ngeom_smooth for drawing smoothed lines (e.g., for simple trends or approximations)\ngeom_bar for drawing bars (e.g., for bar charts)\ngeom_histogram for drawing binned values (e.g. a histogram)\ngeom_polygon for drawing arbitrary shapes\ngeom_map for drawing polygons in the shape of a map! (You can access the data to use for these maps by using the map_data() function).\n\n\n\n\nCollection of Geometry Shapes\n\n\n\nA plot must have at least one geom; there is no upper limit. You can add a geom to a plot using the + operator.\nFor complete list, please refer to here.\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below plots a bar chart by using geom_bar().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a dot plot, each dot represents one observation, and the dot’s width corresponds to the bin width or maximum width (based on the binning algorithm). The geom_dotplot() function in ggplot2 is used to create dot plots.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot(dotsize = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe y scale is not very useful, in fact it is very misleading.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below performs the following two steps:\n\nscale_y_continuous() is used to turn off the y-axis, and\nbinwidth argument is used to change the binwidth to 2.5.\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot(binwidth=2.5,         \n               dotsize = 0.5) +      \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,           \n                     breaks = NULL)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, geom_histogram() is used to create a simple histogram by using values in MATHS field of exam_data.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram()       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below,\n\nbins argument is used to change the number of bins to 20,\nfill argument is used to shade the histogram with light blue color, and\ncolor argument is used to change the outline colour of the bars in black\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20,            \n                 color=\"black\",      \n                 fill=\"light blue\")  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below changes the interior colour of the histogram (i.e. fill) by using sub-group of aesthetic().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           fill = GENDER)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 color=\"grey30\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis approach can be used to colour, fill and alpha of the geometric.\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom-density() computes and plots kernel density estimate, which is a smoothed version of the histogram.\nIt is a useful alternative to the histogram for continuous data that comes from an underlying smooth distribution.\nThe code below plots the distribution of Maths scores in a kernel density estimate plot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_density()           \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below plots two kernel density lines by using colour or fill arguments of aes()\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS, \n           colour = GENDER)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_boxplot() displays continuous value list. It visualises five summary statistics (the median, two hinges and two whiskers), and all “outlying” points individually.\nThe code chunk below plots boxplots by using geom_boxplot().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS,       \n           x= GENDER)) +    \n  geom_boxplot()            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotches are used in box plots to help visually assess whether the medians of distributions differ. If the notches do not overlap, this is evidence that the medians are different.\nThe code chunk below plots the distribution of Maths scores by gender in notched plot instead of boxplot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_violin is designed for creating violin plot. Violin plots are a way of comparing multiple data distributions. With ordinary density curves, it is difficult to compare more than just a few distributions because the lines visually interfere with each other. With a violin plot, it’s easier to compare several distributions since they’re placed side by side.\nThe code below plot the distribution of Maths score by gender in violin plot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_violin()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_point() is especially useful for creating scatterplot.\nThe code chunk below plots a scatterplot showing the Maths and English grades of pupils by using geom_point().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point()            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below plots the data points on the boxplots by using both geom_boxplot() and geom_point().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +                    \n  geom_point(position=\"jitter\", \n             size = 0.5)        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Statistics functions statistically transform data, usually as some form of summary. For example:\n\nfrequency of values of a variable (bar graph)\n\na mean\na confidence limit\n\nThere are two ways to use these functions:\n\nadd a stat_() function and override the default geom, or\nadd a geom_() function and override the default stat.\n\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below adds mean values by using stat_summary() function and overriding the default geom.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  stat_summary(geom = \"point\",       \n               fun = \"mean\",         \n               colour =\"red\",        \n               size=4)               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below adding mean values by using geom_() function and overriding the default stat.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  geom_point(stat=\"summary\",        \n             fun=\"mean\",           \n             colour=\"red\",          \n             size=4)          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scatterplot below shows the relationship of Maths and English grades of pupils. The interpretability of this graph can be improved by adding a best fit curve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, geom_smooth() is used to plot a best fit curve on the scatterplot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(size=0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nThe default method used is loess.\n\n\n\nThe default smoothing method can be overridden as shown below.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              linewidth=0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacetting generates small multiples (sometimes also called trellis plot), each displaying a different subset of the data. They are an alternative to aesthetics for displaying additional discrete variables. ggplot2 supports two types of factes, namely: facet_grid and facet_wrap.\n\n\nfacet_wrap wraps a 1d sequence of panels into 2d.

Heatmaps are good for showing variance across multiple variables, revealing any patterns, displaying whether any variables are similar to each other, and for detecting if any correlations exist in-between them.\nIn this hands-on exercise, you will gain hands-on experience on using R to plot static and interactive heatmap for visualising and analysing multivariate data.\n\n\n\nBefore you get started, you are required to open a new Quarto document. Keep the default html as the authoring format.\nNext, you will use the code chunk below to install and launch seriation, heatmaply, dendextend and tidyverse in RStudio.\n\npacman::p_load(seriation, dendextend, heatmaply, tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, the data of World Happines 2018 report will be used. The data set is downloaded from here. The original data set is in Microsoft Excel format. It has been extracted and saved in csv file called WHData-2018.csv.\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, read_csv() of readr is used to import WHData-2018.csv into R and parsed it into tibble R data frame format.\n\nwh &lt;- read_csv(\"../data/WHData-2018.csv\")\n\nThe output tibbled data frame is called wh.\n\n\n\nNext, we need to change the rows by country name instead of row number by using the code chunk below\n\nrow.names(wh) &lt;- wh$Country\n\nNotice that the row number has been replaced into the country name.\n\n\n\nThe data was loaded into a data frame, but it has to be a data matrix to make your heatmap.\nThe code chunk below will be used to transform wh data frame into a data matrix.\n\nwh1 &lt;- dplyr::select(wh, c(3, 7:12))\nwh_matrix &lt;- data.matrix(wh)\n\nNotice that wh_matrix is in R matrix format.\n\n\n\n\nThere are many R packages and functions can be used to drawing static heatmaps, they are:\n\nheatmap()of R stats package.

The full reference guide of the package is available here.\nsuperheat package: A Graphical Tool for Exploring Complex Datasets Using Heatmaps. A system for generating extendable and customizable heatmaps for exploring complex datasets, including big data and data with multiple data types. The full reference guide of the package is available here.\n\nIn this section, you will learn how to plot static heatmaps by using heatmap() of R Stats package.\n\n\nIn this sub-section, we will plot a heatmap by using heatmap() of Base Stats. The code chunk is given below.\n\nwh_heatmap &lt;- heatmap(wh_matrix,\n                      Rowv=NA, Colv=NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\nBy default, heatmap() plots a cluster heatmap. The arguments Rowv=NA and Colv=NA are used to switch off the option of plotting the row and column dendrograms.\n\nTo plot a cluster heatmap, we just have to use the default as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nwh_heatmap &lt;- heatmap(wh_matrix)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\nThe order of both rows and columns is different compare to the native wh_matrix. This is because heatmap do a reordering using clusterisation: it calculates the distance between each pair of rows and columns and try to order them by similarity. Moreover, the corresponding dendrogram are provided beside the heatmap.\n\nHere, red cells denotes small values, and red small ones. This heatmap is not really informative. Indeed, the Happiness Score variable have relatively higher values, what makes that the other variables with small values all look the same. Thus, we need to normalize this matrix. This is done using the scale argument. It can be applied to rows or to columns following your needs.\nThe code chunk below normalises the matrix column-wise.\n\nwh_heatmap &lt;- heatmap(wh_matrix,\n                      scale=\"column\",\n                      cexRow = 0.6, \n                      cexCol = 0.8,\n                      margins = c(10, 4))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the values are scaled now. Also note that margins argument is used to ensure that the entire x-axis labels are displayed completely and, cexRow and cexCol arguments are used to define the font size used for y-axis and x-axis labels respectively.\n\n\n\n\nheatmaply is an R package for building interactive cluster heatmap that can be shared online as a stand-alone HTML file. It is designed and maintained by Tal Galili.\nBefore we get started, you should review the Introduction to Heatmaply to have an overall understanding of the features and functions of Heatmaply package. You are also required to have the user manualof the package handy with you for reference purposes.\nIn this section, you will gain hands-on experience on using heatmaply to design an interactive cluster heatmap. We will still use the wh_matrix as the input data.\n\n\n\nheatmaply(mtcars)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below shows the basic syntax needed to create n interactive heatmap by using heatmaply package.\n\nheatmaply(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)])\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that:\n\nDifferent from heatmap(), for heatmaply() the default horizontal dendrogram is placed on the left hand side of the heatmap.\nThe text label of each raw, on the other hand, is placed on the right hand side of the heat map.\nWhen the x-axis marker labels are too long, they will be rotated by 135 degree from the north.\n\n\n\n\nWhen analysing multivariate data set, it is very common that the variables in the data sets includes values that reflect different types of measurement. In general, these variables’ values have their own range. In order to ensure that all the variables have comparable values, data transformation are commonly used before clustering.\nThree main data transformation methods are supported by heatmaply(), namely: scale, normalise and percentilse.\n\n\n\nWhen all variables are came from or assumed to come from some normal distribution, then scaling (i.e.: subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation) would bring them all close to the standard normal distribution.\nIn such a case, each value would reflect the distance from the mean in units of standard deviation.\nThe scale argument in heatmaply() supports column and row scaling.\n\nThe code chunk below is used to scale variable values columewise.\n\nheatmaply(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)],\n          scale = \"column\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen variables in the data comes from possibly different (and non-normal) distributions, the normalize function can be used to bring data to the 0 to 1 scale by subtracting the minimum and dividing by the maximum of all observations.\nThis preserves the shape of each variable’s distribution while making them easily comparable on the same “scale”.\n\nDifferent from Scaling, the normalise method is performed on the input data set i.e. wh_matrix as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is similar to ranking the variables, but instead of keeping the rank values, divide them by the maximal rank.\nThis is done by using the ecdf of the variables on their own values, bringing each value to its empirical percentile.\nThe benefit of the percentize function is that each value has a relatively clear interpretation, it is the percent of observations that got that value or below it.\n\nSimilar to Normalize method, the Percentize method is also performed on the input data set i.e. wh_matrix as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nheatmaply(percentize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nheatmaply supports a variety of hierarchical clustering algorithm. The main arguments provided are:\n\ndistfun: function used to compute the distance (dissimilarity) between both rows and columns. Defaults to dist. The options “pearson”, “spearman” and “kendall” can be used to use correlation-based clustering, which uses as.dist(1 - cor(t(x))) as the distance metric (using the specified correlation method).\nhclustfun: function used to compute the hierarchical clustering when Rowv or Colv are not dendrograms. Defaults to hclust.\ndist_method default is NULL, which results in “euclidean” to be used. It can accept alternative character strings indicating the method to be passed to distfun. By default distfun is “dist”” hence this can be one of “euclidean”, “maximum”, “manhattan”, “canberra”, “binary” or “minkowski”.\nhclust_method default is NULL, which results in “complete” method to be used. It can accept alternative character strings indicating the method to be passed to hclustfun. By default hclustfun is hclust hence this can be one of “ward.D”, “ward.D2”, “single”, “complete”, “average” (= UPGMA), “mcquitty” (= WPGMA), “median” (= WPGMC) or “centroid” (= UPGMC).\n\nIn general, a clustering model can be calibrated either manually or statistically.\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, the heatmap is plotted by using hierachical clustering algorithm with “Euclidean distance” and “ward.D” method.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          dist_method = \"euclidean\",\n          hclust_method = \"ward.D\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to determine the best clustering method and number of cluster the dend_expend() and find_k() functions of dendextend package will be used.\nFirst, the dend_expend() will be used to determine the recommended clustering method to be used.\n\nwh_d &lt;- dist(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]), method = \"euclidean\")\ndend_expend(wh_d)[[3]]\n\n  dist_methods hclust_methods     optim\n1      unknown         ward.D 0.6137851\n2      unknown        ward.D2 0.6289186\n3      unknown         single 0.4774362\n4      unknown       complete 0.6434009\n5      unknown        average 0.6701688\n6      unknown       mcquitty 0.5020102\n7      unknown         median 0.5901833\n8      unknown       centroid 0.6338734\n\n\nThe output table shows that “average” method should be used because it gave the high optimum value.\nNext, find_k() is used to determine the optimal number of cluster.\n\nwh_clust &lt;- hclust(wh_d, method = \"average\")\nnum_k &lt;- find_k(wh_clust)\nplot(num_k)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure above shows that k=3 would be good.\nWith reference to the statistical analysis results, we can prepare the code chunk as shown below.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          dist_method = \"euclidean\",\n          hclust_method = \"average\",\n          k_row = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the problems with hierarchical clustering is that it doesn’t actually place the rows in a definite order, it merely constrains the space of possible orderings. Take three items A, B and C. If you ignore reflections, there are three possible orderings: ABC, ACB, BAC. If clustering them gives you ((A+B)+C) as a tree, you know that C can’t end up between A and B, but it doesn’t tell you which way to flip the A+B cluster. It doesn’t tell you if the ABC ordering will lead to a clearer-looking heatmap than the BAC ordering.\nheatmaply uses the seriation package to find an optimal ordering of rows and columns. Optimal means to optimize the Hamiltonian path length that is restricted by the dendrogram structure. This, in other words, means to rotate the branches so that the sum of distances between each adjacent leaf (label) will be minimized. This is related to a restricted version of the travelling salesman problem.\nHere we meet our first seriation algorithm: Optimal Leaf Ordering (OLO). This algorithm starts with the output of an agglomerative clustering algorithm and produces a unique ordering, one that flips the various branches of the dendrogram around so as to minimize the sum of dissimilarities between adjacent leaves. Here is the result of applying Optimal Leaf Ordering to the same clustering result as the heatmap above.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"OLO\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default options is “OLO” (Optimal leaf ordering) which optimizes the above criterion (in O(n^4)). Another option is “GW” (Gruvaeus and Wainer) which aims for the same goal but uses a potentially faster heuristic.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"GW\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe option “mean” gives the output we would get by default from heatmap functions in other packages such as gplots::heatmap.2.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"mean\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe option “none” gives us the dendrograms without any rotation that is based on the data matrix.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default colour palette uses by heatmaply is viridis. heatmaply users, however, can use other colour palettes in order to improve the aestheticness and visual friendliness of the heatmap.\nIn the code chunk below, the Blues colour palette of rColorBrewer is used\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"none\",\n          colors = Blues)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeside providing a wide collection of arguments for meeting the statistical analysis needs, heatmaply also provides many plotting features to ensure cartographic quality heatmap can be produced.\nIn the code chunk below the following arguments are used:\n\nk_row is used to produce 5 groups.\nmargins is used to change the top margin to 60 and row margin to 200.\nfontsizw_row and fontsize_col are used to change the font size for row and column labels to 4.\nmain is used to write the main title of the plot.\nxlab and ylab are used to write the x-axis and y-axis labels respectively.\n\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          Colv=NA,\n          seriate = \"none\",\n          colors = Blues,\n          k_row = 5,\n          margins = c(NA,200,60,NA),\n          fontsize_row = 4,\n          fontsize_col = 5,\n          main=\"World Happiness Score and Variables by Country, 2018 \\nDataTransformation using Normalise Method\",\n          xlab = \"World Happiness Indicators\",\n          ylab = \"World Countries\"\n          )"

By default hclustfun is hclust hence this can be one of “ward.D”, “ward.D2”, “single”, “complete”, “average” (= UPGMA), “mcquitty” (= WPGMA), “median” (= WPGMC) or “centroid” (= UPGMC).\n\nIn general, a clustering model can be calibrated either manually or statistically.\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, the heatmap is plotted by using hierachical clustering algorithm with “Euclidean distance” and “ward.D” method.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          dist_method = \"euclidean\",\n          hclust_method = \"ward.D\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to determine the best clustering method and number of cluster the dend_expend() and find_k() functions of dendextend package will be used.\nFirst, the dend_expend() will be used to determine the recommended clustering method to be used.\n\nwh_d &lt;- dist(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]), method = \"euclidean\")\ndend_expend(wh_d)[[3]]\n\n  dist_methods hclust_methods     optim\n1      unknown         ward.D 0.6137851\n2      unknown        ward.D2 0.6289186\n3      unknown         single 0.4774362\n4      unknown       complete 0.6434009\n5      unknown        average 0.6701688\n6      unknown       mcquitty 0.5020102\n7      unknown         median 0.5901833\n8      unknown       centroid 0.6338734\n\n\nThe output table shows that “average” method should be used because it gave the high optimum value.\nNext, find_k() is used to determine the optimal number of cluster.\n\nwh_clust &lt;- hclust(wh_d, method = \"average\")\nnum_k &lt;- find_k(wh_clust)\nplot(num_k)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure above shows that k=3 would be good.\nWith reference to the statistical analysis results, we can prepare the code chunk as shown below.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          dist_method = \"euclidean\",\n          hclust_method = \"average\",\n          k_row = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the problems with hierarchical clustering is that it doesn’t actually place the rows in a definite order, it merely constrains the space of possible orderings. Take three items A, B and C. If you ignore reflections, there are three possible orderings: ABC, ACB, BAC. If clustering them gives you ((A+B)+C) as a tree, you know that C can’t end up between A and B, but it doesn’t tell you which way to flip the A+B cluster. It doesn’t tell you if the ABC ordering will lead to a clearer-looking heatmap than the BAC ordering.\nheatmaply uses the seriation package to find an optimal ordering of rows and columns. Optimal means to optimize the Hamiltonian path length that is restricted by the dendrogram structure. This, in other words, means to rotate the branches so that the sum of distances between each adjacent leaf (label) will be minimized. This is related to a restricted version of the travelling salesman problem.\nHere we meet our first seriation algorithm: Optimal Leaf Ordering (OLO). This algorithm starts with the output of an agglomerative clustering algorithm and produces a unique ordering, one that flips the various branches of the dendrogram around so as to minimize the sum of dissimilarities between adjacent leaves. Here is the result of applying Optimal Leaf Ordering to the same clustering result as the heatmap above.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"OLO\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default options is “OLO” (Optimal leaf ordering) which optimizes the above criterion (in O(n^4)). Another option is “GW” (Gruvaeus and Wainer) which aims for the same goal but uses a potentially faster heuristic.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"GW\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe option “mean” gives the output we would get by default from heatmap functions in other packages such as gplots::heatmap.2.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"mean\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe option “none” gives us the dendrograms without any rotation that is based on the data matrix.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default colour palette uses by heatmaply is viridis. heatmaply users, however, can use other colour palettes in order to improve the aestheticness and visual friendliness of the heatmap.\nIn the code chunk below, the Blues colour palette of rColorBrewer is used\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"none\",\n          colors = Blues)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeside providing a wide collection of arguments for meeting the statistical analysis needs, heatmaply also provides many plotting features to ensure cartographic quality heatmap can be produced.\nIn the code chunk below the following arguments are used:\n\nk_row is used to produce 5 groups.\nmargins is used to change the top margin to 60 and row margin to 200.\nfontsizw_row and fontsize_col are used to change the font size for row and column labels to 4.\nmain is used to write the main title of the plot.\nxlab and ylab are used to write the x-axis and y-axis labels respectively.\n\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          Colv=NA,\n          seriate = \"none\",\n          colors = Blues,\n          k_row = 5,\n          margins = c(NA,200,60,NA),\n          fontsize_row = 4,\n          fontsize_col = 5,\n          main=\"World Happiness Score and Variables by Country, 2018 \\nDataTransformation using Normalise Method\",\n          xlab = \"World Happiness Indicators\",\n          ylab = \"World Countries\"\n          )"

    "text": "In this hands-on exercise, you will gain hands-on experiences on designing treemap using appropriate R packages. The hands-on exercise consists of three main section. First, you will learn how to manipulate transaction data into a treemap strcuture by using selected functions provided in dplyr package. Then, you will learn how to plot static treemap by using treemap package. In the third section, you will learn how to design interactive treemap by using d3treeR package.\n\n\n\nBefore we get started, you are required to check if treemap and tidyverse pacakges have been installed in you R.\n\npacman::p_load(treemap, treemapify, tidyverse) \n\n\n\n\nIn this exercise, REALIS2018.csv data will be used. This dataset provides information of private property transaction records in 2018. The dataset is extracted from REALIS portal (https://spring.ura.gov.sg/lad/ore/login/index.cfm) of Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA).\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, read_csv() of readr is used to import realis2018.csv into R and parsed it into tibble R data.frame format.\n\nrealis2018 &lt;- read_csv(\"../data/realis2018.csv\")\n\nThe output tibble data.frame is called realis2018.\n\n\n\nThe data.frame realis2018 is in trasaction record form, which is highly disaggregated and not appropriate to be used to plot a treemap. In this section, we will perform the following steps to manipulate and prepare a data.frtame that is appropriate for treemap visualisation:\n\ngroup transaction records by Project Name, Planning Region, Planning Area, Property Type and Type of Sale, and\ncompute Total Unit Sold, Total Area, Median Unit Price and Median Transacted Price by applying appropriate summary statistics on No. of Units, Area (sqm), Unit Price ($ psm) and Transacted Price ($) respectively.\n\nTwo key verbs of dplyr package, namely: group_by() and summarize() will be used to perform these steps.\ngroup_by() breaks down a data.frame into specified groups of rows. When you then apply the verbs above on the resulting object they’ll be automatically applied “by group”.\nGrouping affects the verbs as follows:\n\ngrouped select() is the same as ungrouped select(), except that grouping variables are always retained.\ngrouped arrange() is the same as ungrouped; unless you set .by_group = TRUE, in which case it orders first by the grouping variables.\nmutate() and filter() are most useful in conjunction with window functions (like rank(), or min(x) == x). They are described in detail in vignette(“window-functions”).\nsample_n() and sample_frac() sample the specified number/fraction of rows in each group.\nsummarise() computes the summary for each group.\n\nIn our case, group_by() will used together with summarise() to derive the summarised data.frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendation\n\n\n\nStudents who are new to dplyr methods should consult Introduction to dplyr before moving on to the next section.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chank below shows a typical two lines code approach to perform the steps.\n\nrealis2018_grouped &lt;- group_by(realis2018, `Project Name`,\n                               `Planning Region`, `Planning Area`, \n                               `Property Type`, `Type of Sale`)\nrealis2018_summarised &lt;- summarise(realis2018_grouped, \n                          `Total Unit Sold` = sum(`No. of Units`, na.rm = TRUE),\n                          `Total Area` = sum(`Area (sqm)`, na.rm = TRUE),\n                          `Median Unit Price ($ psm)` = median(`Unit Price ($ psm)`, na.rm = TRUE), \n                          `Median Transacted Price` = median(`Transacted Price ($)`, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nAggregation functions such as sum() and meadian() obey the usual rule of missing values: if there’s any missing value in the input, the output will be a missing value. The argument na.rm = TRUE removes the missing values prior to computation.\n\n\n\nThe code chunk above is not very efficient because we have to give each intermediate data.frame a name, even though we don’t have to care about it.\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below shows a more efficient way to tackle the same processes by using the pipe, %&gt;%:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendation\n\n\n\nTo learn more about pipe, visit this excellent article: Pipes in R Tutorial For Beginners.\n\n\n\nrealis2018_summarised &lt;- realis2018 %&gt;% \n  group_by(`Project Name`,`Planning Region`, \n           `Planning Area`, `Property Type`, \n           `Type of Sale`) %&gt;%\n  summarise(`Total Unit Sold` = sum(`No. of Units`, na.rm = TRUE), \n            `Total Area` = sum(`Area (sqm)`, na.rm = TRUE),\n            `Median Unit Price ($ psm)` = median(`Unit Price ($ psm)`, na.rm = TRUE),\n            `Median Transacted Price` = median(`Transacted Price ($)`, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\n\n\n\ntreemap package is a R package specially designed to offer great flexibility in drawing treemaps. The core function, namely: treemap() offers at least 43 arguments. In this section, we will only explore the major arguments for designing elegent and yet truthful treemaps.\n\n\nIn this section, treemap() of Treemap package is used to plot a treemap showing the distribution of median unit prices and total unit sold of resale condominium by geographic hierarchy in 2017.\nFirst, we will select records belongs to resale condominium property type from realis2018_selected data frame.\n\nrealis2018_selected &lt;- realis2018_summarised %&gt;%\n  filter(`Property Type` == \"Condominium\", `Type of Sale` == \"Resale\")\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below designed a treemap by using three core arguments of treemap(), namely: index, vSize and vColor.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the three arguments used:\n\nindex\n\nThe index vector must consist of at least two column names or else no hierarchy treemap will be plotted.\nIf multiple column names are provided, such as the code chunk above, the first name is the highest aggregation level, the second name the second highest aggregation level, and so on.\n\nvSize\n\nThe column must not contain negative values. This is because it’s vaues will be used to map the sizes of the rectangles of the treemaps.\n\n\nWarning:\nThe treemap above was wrongly coloured. For a correctly designed treemap, the colours of the rectagles should be in different intensity showing, in our case, median unit prices.\nFor treemap(), vColor is used in combination with the argument type to determines the colours of the rectangles. Without defining type, like the code chunk above, treemap() assumes type = index, in our case, the hierarchy of planning areas.\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, type argument is define as value.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type = \"value\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThinking to learn from the conde chunk above.\n\nThe rectangles are coloured with different intensity of green, reflecting their respective median unit prices.\nThe legend reveals that the values are binned into ten bins, i.e. 0-5000, 5000-10000, etc. with an equal interval of 5000.\n\n\n\n\nThere are two arguments that determine the mapping to color palettes: mapping and palette. The only difference between “value” and “manual” is the default value for mapping. The “value” treemap considers palette to be a diverging color palette (say ColorBrewer’s “RdYlBu”), and maps it in such a way that 0 corresponds to the middle color (typically white or yellow), -max(abs(values)) to the left-end color, and max(abs(values)), to the right-end color. The “manual” treemap simply maps min(values) to the left-end color, max(values) to the right-end color, and mean(range(values)) to the middle color.\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below shows a value type treemap.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"value\",\n        palette=\"RdYlBu\", \n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nalthough the colour palette used is RdYlBu but there are no red rectangles in the treemap above. This is because all the median unit prices are positive.\nThe reason why we see only 5000 to 45000 in the legend is because the range argument is by default c(min(values, max(values)) with some pretty rounding.\n\n\n\n\nThe “manual” type does not interpret the values as the “value” type does. Instead, the value range is mapped linearly to the colour palette.\nThe code chunk below shows a manual type treemap.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"RdYlBu\", \n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nThe colour scheme used is very copnfusing. This is because mapping = (min(values), mean(range(values)), max(values)). It is not wise to use diverging colour palette such as RdYlBu if the values are all positive or negative\n\nTo overcome this problem, a single colour palette such as Blues should be used.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"Blues\", \n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntreemap() supports two popular treemap layouts, namely: “squarified” and “pivotSize”. The default is “pivotSize”.\nThe squarified treemap algorithm (Bruls et al., 2000) produces good aspect ratios, but ignores the sorting order of the rectangles (sortID). The ordered treemap, pivot-by-size, algorithm (Bederson et al., 2002) takes the sorting order (sortID) into account while aspect ratios are still acceptable.\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below plots a squarified treemap by changing the algorithm argument.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"Blues\", \n        algorithm = \"squarified\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen “pivotSize” algorithm is used, sortID argument can be used to dertemine the order in which the rectangles are placed from top left to bottom right.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"Blues\", \n        algorithm = \"pivotSize\",\n        sortID = \"Median Transacted Price\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntreemapify is a R package specially developed to draw treemaps in ggplot2. In this section, you will learn how to designing treemps closely resemble treemaps designing in previous section by using treemapify. Before you getting started, you should read Introduction to “treemapify” its user guide.\n\n\n\nggplot(data=realis2018_selected, \n       aes(area = `Total Unit Sold`,\n           fill = `Median Unit Price ($ psm)`),\n       layout = \"scol\",\n       start = \"bottomleft\") + \n  geom_treemap() +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"light blue\", high = \"blue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup by Planning Region\n\nggplot(data=realis2018_selected, \n       aes(area = `Total Unit Sold`,\n           fill = `Median Unit Price ($ psm)`,\n           subgroup = `Planning Region`),\n       start = \"topleft\") + \n  geom_treemap()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup by Planning Area\n\nggplot(data=realis2018_selected, \n       aes(area = `Total Unit Sold`,\n           fill = `Median Unit Price ($ psm)`,\n           subgroup = `Planning Region`,\n           subgroup2 = `Planning Area`)) + \n  geom_treemap()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding boundary line\n\nggplot(data=realis2018_selected, \n       aes(area = `Total Unit Sold`,\n           fill = `Median Unit Price ($ psm)`,\n           subgroup = `Planning Region`,\n           subgroup2 = `Planning Area`)) + \n  geom_treemap() +\n  geom_treemap_subgroup2_border(colour = \"gray40\",\n                                size = 2) +\n  geom_treemap_subgroup_border(colour = \"gray20\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis slide shows you how to install a R package which is not available in cran.\n\nIf this is the first time you install a package from github, you should install devtools package by using the code below or else you can skip this step.\n\n\n# install.packages(\"devtools\")\n\n\nNext, you will load the devtools library and install the package found in github by using the codes below.\n\n\nlibrary(devtools)\ninstall_github(\"timelyportfolio/d3treeR\")\n\nXML       (NA -&gt; 3.99-0.18) [CRAN]\ngridSVG   (NA -&gt; 1.7-5    ) [CRAN]\ndata.tree (NA -&gt; 1.1.0    ) [CRAN]\n\n\n\nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n    /var/folders/fy/3kpzvcyn6wsb0fc4_vc1ndzw0000gn/T//RtmpZ1NnrH/downloaded_packages\n── R CMD build ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n* checking for file ‘/private/var/folders/fy/3kpzvcyn6wsb0fc4_vc1ndzw0000gn/T/RtmpZ1NnrH/remotes43db1e5fa93/d3treeR-d3treeR-ebb833d/DESCRIPTION’ ...

The dataset is extracted from REALIS portal (https://spring.ura.gov.sg/lad/ore/login/index.cfm) of Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA).\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, read_csv() of readr is used to import realis2018.csv into R and parsed it into tibble R data.frame format.\n\nrealis2018 &lt;- read_csv(\"../data/realis2018.csv\")\n\nThe output tibble data.frame is called realis2018.\n\n\n\nThe data.frame realis2018 is in trasaction record form, which is highly disaggregated and not appropriate to be used to plot a treemap. In this section, we will perform the following steps to manipulate and prepare a data.frtame that is appropriate for treemap visualisation:\n\ngroup transaction records by Project Name, Planning Region, Planning Area, Property Type and Type of Sale, and\ncompute Total Unit Sold, Total Area, Median Unit Price and Median Transacted Price by applying appropriate summary statistics on No. of Units, Area (sqm), Unit Price ($ psm) and Transacted Price ($) respectively.\n\nTwo key verbs of dplyr package, namely: group_by() and summarize() will be used to perform these steps.\ngroup_by() breaks down a data.frame into specified groups of rows. When you then apply the verbs above on the resulting object they’ll be automatically applied “by group”.\nGrouping affects the verbs as follows:\n\ngrouped select() is the same as ungrouped select(), except that grouping variables are always retained.\ngrouped arrange() is the same as ungrouped; unless you set .by_group = TRUE, in which case it orders first by the grouping variables.\nmutate() and filter() are most useful in conjunction with window functions (like rank(), or min(x) == x). They are described in detail in vignette(“window-functions”).\nsample_n() and sample_frac() sample the specified number/fraction of rows in each group.\nsummarise() computes the summary for each group.\n\nIn our case, group_by() will used together with summarise() to derive the summarised data.frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendation\n\n\n\nStudents who are new to dplyr methods should consult Introduction to dplyr before moving on to the next section.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chank below shows a typical two lines code approach to perform the steps.\n\nrealis2018_grouped &lt;- group_by(realis2018, `Project Name`,\n                               `Planning Region`, `Planning Area`, \n                               `Property Type`, `Type of Sale`)\nrealis2018_summarised &lt;- summarise(realis2018_grouped, \n                          `Total Unit Sold` = sum(`No. of Units`, na.rm = TRUE),\n                          `Total Area` = sum(`Area (sqm)`, na.rm = TRUE),\n                          `Median Unit Price ($ psm)` = median(`Unit Price ($ psm)`, na.rm = TRUE), \n                          `Median Transacted Price` = median(`Transacted Price ($)`, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nAggregation functions such as sum() and meadian() obey the usual rule of missing values: if there’s any missing value in the input, the output will be a missing value. The argument na.rm = TRUE removes the missing values prior to computation.\n\n\n\nThe code chunk above is not very efficient because we have to give each intermediate data.frame a name, even though we don’t have to care about it.\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below shows a more efficient way to tackle the same processes by using the pipe, %&gt;%:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendation\n\n\n\nTo learn more about pipe, visit this excellent article: Pipes in R Tutorial For Beginners.\n\n\n\nrealis2018_summarised &lt;- realis2018 %&gt;% \n  group_by(`Project Name`,`Planning Region`, \n           `Planning Area`, `Property Type`, \n           `Type of Sale`) %&gt;%\n  summarise(`Total Unit Sold` = sum(`No. of Units`, na.rm = TRUE), \n            `Total Area` = sum(`Area (sqm)`, na.rm = TRUE),\n            `Median Unit Price ($ psm)` = median(`Unit Price ($ psm)`, na.rm = TRUE),\n            `Median Transacted Price` = median(`Transacted Price ($)`, na.rm = TRUE))"

    "text": "treemap package is a R package specially designed to offer great flexibility in drawing treemaps. The core function, namely: treemap() offers at least 43 arguments. In this section, we will only explore the major arguments for designing elegent and yet truthful treemaps.\n\n\nIn this section, treemap() of Treemap package is used to plot a treemap showing the distribution of median unit prices and total unit sold of resale condominium by geographic hierarchy in 2017.\nFirst, we will select records belongs to resale condominium property type from realis2018_selected data frame.\n\nrealis2018_selected &lt;- realis2018_summarised %&gt;%\n  filter(`Property Type` == \"Condominium\", `Type of Sale` == \"Resale\")\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below designed a treemap by using three core arguments of treemap(), namely: index, vSize and vColor.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the three arguments used:\n\nindex\n\nThe index vector must consist of at least two column names or else no hierarchy treemap will be plotted.\nIf multiple column names are provided, such as the code chunk above, the first name is the highest aggregation level, the second name the second highest aggregation level, and so on.\n\nvSize\n\nThe column must not contain negative values. This is because it’s vaues will be used to map the sizes of the rectangles of the treemaps.\n\n\nWarning:\nThe treemap above was wrongly coloured. For a correctly designed treemap, the colours of the rectagles should be in different intensity showing, in our case, median unit prices.\nFor treemap(), vColor is used in combination with the argument type to determines the colours of the rectangles. Without defining type, like the code chunk above, treemap() assumes type = index, in our case, the hierarchy of planning areas.\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, type argument is define as value.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type = \"value\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThinking to learn from the conde chunk above.\n\nThe rectangles are coloured with different intensity of green, reflecting their respective median unit prices.\nThe legend reveals that the values are binned into ten bins, i.e. 0-5000, 5000-10000, etc. with an equal interval of 5000.\n\n\n\n\nThere are two arguments that determine the mapping to color palettes: mapping and palette. The only difference between “value” and “manual” is the default value for mapping. The “value” treemap considers palette to be a diverging color palette (say ColorBrewer’s “RdYlBu”), and maps it in such a way that 0 corresponds to the middle color (typically white or yellow), -max(abs(values)) to the left-end color, and max(abs(values)), to the right-end color. The “manual” treemap simply maps min(values) to the left-end color, max(values) to the right-end color, and mean(range(values)) to the middle color.\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below shows a value type treemap.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"value\",\n        palette=\"RdYlBu\", \n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nalthough the colour palette used is RdYlBu but there are no red rectangles in the treemap above. This is because all the median unit prices are positive.\nThe reason why we see only 5000 to 45000 in the legend is because the range argument is by default c(min(values, max(values)) with some pretty rounding.\n\n\n\n\nThe “manual” type does not interpret the values as the “value” type does. Instead, the value range is mapped linearly to the colour palette.\nThe code chunk below shows a manual type treemap.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"RdYlBu\", \n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nThe colour scheme used is very copnfusing. This is because mapping = (min(values), mean(range(values)), max(values)). It is not wise to use diverging colour palette such as RdYlBu if the values are all positive or negative\n\nTo overcome this problem, a single colour palette such as Blues should be used.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"Blues\", \n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntreemap() supports two popular treemap layouts, namely: “squarified” and “pivotSize”. The default is “pivotSize”.\nThe squarified treemap algorithm (Bruls et al., 2000) produces good aspect ratios, but ignores the sorting order of the rectangles (sortID). The ordered treemap, pivot-by-size, algorithm (Bederson et al., 2002) takes the sorting order (sortID) into account while aspect ratios are still acceptable.\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below plots a squarified treemap by changing the algorithm argument.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"Blues\", \n        algorithm = \"squarified\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen “pivotSize” algorithm is used, sortID argument can be used to dertemine the order in which the rectangles are placed from top left to bottom right.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"Blues\", \n        algorithm = \"pivotSize\",\n        sortID = \"Median Transacted Price\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )"

    "text": "Visualising distribution is not new in statistical analysis. In chapter 1 we have shared with you some of the popular statistical graphics methods for visualising distribution are histogram, probability density curve (pdf), boxplot, notch plot and violin plot and how they can be created by using ggplot2. In this chapter, we are going to share with you two relatively new statistical graphic methods for visualising distribution, namely ridgeline plot and raincloud plot by using ggplot2 and its extensions.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the purpose of this exercise, the following R packages will be used, they are:\n\nggridges, a ggplot2 extension specially designed for plotting ridgeline plots,\nggdist, a ggplot2 extension spacially desgin for visualising distribution and uncertainty,\ntidyverse, a family of R packages to meet the modern data science and visual communication needs,\nggthemes, a ggplot extension that provides the user additional themes, scales, and geoms for the ggplots package, and\ncolorspace, an R package provides a broad toolbox for selecting individual colors or color palettes, manipulating these colors, and employing them in various kinds of visualisations.\n\nThe code chunk below will be used load these R packages into RStudio environment.\n\npacman::p_load(ggdist, ggridges, ggthemes,\n               colorspace, tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the purpose of this exercise, Exam_data.csv will be used.\nIn the code chunk below, read_csv() of readr package is used to import Exam_data.csv into R and saved it into a tibble data.frame.\n\nexam &lt;- read_csv(\"../data/Exam_data.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nRidgeline plot (sometimes called Joyplot) is a data visualisation technique for revealing the distribution of a numeric value for several groups. Distribution can be represented using histograms or density plots, all aligned to the same horizontal scale and presented with a slight overlap.\nFigure below is a ridgelines plot showing the distribution of English score by class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nRidgeline plots make sense when the number of group to represent is medium to high, and thus a classic window separation would take to much space. Indeed, the fact that groups overlap each other allows to use space more efficiently. If you have less than 5 groups, dealing with other distribution plots is probably better.\nIt works well when there is a clear pattern in the result, like if there is an obvious ranking in groups. Otherwise group will tend to overlap each other, leading to a messy plot not providing any insight.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are several ways to plot ridgeline plot with R. In this section, you will learn how to plot ridgeline plot by using ggridges package.\nggridges package provides two main geom to plot gridgeline plots, they are: geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(). The former takes height values directly to draw the ridgelines, and the latter first estimates data densities and then draws those using ridgelines.\nThe ridgeline plot below is plotted by using geom_density_ridges().\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    bandwidth = 3.4,\n    fill = lighten(\"#7097BB\", .3),\n    color = \"white\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0, 0)\n    ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes we would like to have the area under a ridgeline not filled with a single solid color but rather with colors that vary in some form along the x axis. This effect can be achieved by using either geom_ridgeline_gradient() or geom_density_ridges_gradient().

    "text": "Ridgeline plot (sometimes called Joyplot) is a data visualisation technique for revealing the distribution of a numeric value for several groups. Distribution can be represented using histograms or density plots, all aligned to the same horizontal scale and presented with a slight overlap.\nFigure below is a ridgelines plot showing the distribution of English score by class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nRidgeline plots make sense when the number of group to represent is medium to high, and thus a classic window separation would take to much space. Indeed, the fact that groups overlap each other allows to use space more efficiently. If you have less than 5 groups, dealing with other distribution plots is probably better.\nIt works well when there is a clear pattern in the result, like if there is an obvious ranking in groups. Otherwise group will tend to overlap each other, leading to a messy plot not providing any insight.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are several ways to plot ridgeline plot with R. In this section, you will learn how to plot ridgeline plot by using ggridges package.\nggridges package provides two main geom to plot gridgeline plots, they are: geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(). The former takes height values directly to draw the ridgelines, and the latter first estimates data densities and then draws those using ridgelines.\nThe ridgeline plot below is plotted by using geom_density_ridges().\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    bandwidth = 3.4,\n    fill = lighten(\"#7097BB\", .3),\n    color = \"white\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0, 0)\n    ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes we would like to have the area under a ridgeline not filled with a single solid color but rather with colors that vary in some form along the x axis. This effect can be achieved by using either geom_ridgeline_gradient() or geom_density_ridges_gradient(). Both geoms work just like geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(), except that they allow for varying fill colors. However, they do not allow for alpha transparency in the fill.

It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories.\nThat’s because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.\nWhen we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as B10.

It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories.\nThat’s because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.\nWhen we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as B10. It can be defined mathematically as\n\n\n\nThe Schwarz criterion is one of the easiest ways to calculate rough approximation of the Bayes Factor.\n\n\n\n\nA Bayes Factor can be any positive number. One of the most common interpretations is this one—first proposed by Harold Jeffereys (1961) and slightly modified by Lee and Wagenmakers in 2013:\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, ggbetweenstats() is used to build a visual for two-sample mean test of Maths scores by gender.\n\nggbetweenstats(\n  data = exam,\n  x = GENDER, \n  y = MATHS,\n  type = \"np\",\n  messages = FALSE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefault information: - statistical details - Bayes Factor - sample sizes - distribution summary\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, ggbetweenstats() is used to build a visual for One-way ANOVA test on English score by race.\n\nggbetweenstats(\n  data = exam,\n  x = RACE, \n  y = ENGLISH,\n  type = \"p\",\n  mean.ci = TRUE, \n  pairwise.comparisons = TRUE, \n  pairwise.display = \"s\",\n  p.adjust.method = \"fdr\",\n  messages = FALSE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“ns” → only non-significant\n“s” → only significant\n“all” → everything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, ggscatterstats() is used to build a visual for Significant Test of Correlation between Maths scores and English scores.\n\nggscatterstats(\n  data = exam,\n  x = MATHS,\n  y = ENGLISH,\n  marginal = FALSE,\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, the Maths scores is binned into a 4-class variable by using cut().\n\nexam1 &lt;- exam %&gt;% \n  mutate(MATHS_bins = \n           cut(MATHS, \n               breaks = c(0,60,75,85,100))\n)\n\nIn this code chunk below ggbarstats() is used to build a visual for Significant Test of Association\n\nggbarstats(exam1, \n           x = MATHS_bins, \n           y = GENDER)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will learn how to visualise model diagnostic and model parameters by using parameters package.\n\nToyota Corolla case study will be used.

It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories.\nThat’s because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.\nWhen we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as B10. It can be defined mathematically as\n\n\n\nThe Schwarz criterion is one of the easiest ways to calculate rough approximation of the Bayes Factor.\n\n\n\n\nA Bayes Factor can be any positive number.

    "text": "When telling a visually-driven data story, animated graphics tends to attract the interest of the audience and make deeper impression than static graphics. In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to create animated data visualisation by using gganimate and plotly r packages. At the same time, you will also learn how to (i) reshape data by using tidyr package, and (ii) process, wrangle and transform data by using dplyr package.\n\n\nWhen creating animations, the plot does not actually move. Instead, many individual plots are built and then stitched together as movie frames, just like an old-school flip book or cartoon. Each frame is a different plot when conveying motion, which is built using some relevant subset of the aggregate data. The subset drives the flow of the animation when stitched back together.\n\n\n\n\nBefore we dive into the steps for creating an animated statistical graph, it’s important to understand some of the key concepts and terminology related to this type of visualization.\n\nFrame: In an animated line graph, each frame represents a different point in time or a different category. When the frame changes, the data points on the graph are updated to reflect the new data.\nAnimation Attributes: The animation attributes are the settings that control how the animation behaves. For example, you can specify the duration of each frame, the easing function used to transition between frames, and whether to start the animation from the current frame or from the beginning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBefore you start making animated graphs, you should first ask yourself: Does it makes sense to go through the effort? If you are conducting an exploratory data analysis, a animated graphic may not be worth the time investment. However, if you are giving a presentation, a few well-placed animated graphics can help an audience connect with your topic remarkably better than static counterparts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, write a code chunk to check, install and load the following R packages:\n\nplotly, R library for plotting interactive statistical graphs.\ngganimate, an ggplot extension for creating animated statistical graphs.\ngifski converts video frames to GIF animations using pngquant’s fancy features for efficient cross-frame palettes and temporal dithering.

    "text": "When telling a visually-driven data story, animated graphics tends to attract the interest of the audience and make deeper impression than static graphics. In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to create animated data visualisation by using gganimate and plotly r packages. At the same time, you will also learn how to (i) reshape data by using tidyr package, and (ii) process, wrangle and transform data by using dplyr package.\n\n\nWhen creating animations, the plot does not actually move. Instead, many individual plots are built and then stitched together as movie frames, just like an old-school flip book or cartoon. Each frame is a different plot when conveying motion, which is built using some relevant subset of the aggregate data. The subset drives the flow of the animation when stitched back together.\n\n\n\n\nBefore we dive into the steps for creating an animated statistical graph, it’s important to understand some of the key concepts and terminology related to this type of visualization.\n\nFrame: In an animated line graph, each frame represents a different point in time or a different category. When the frame changes, the data points on the graph are updated to reflect the new data.\nAnimation Attributes: The animation attributes are the settings that control how the animation behaves. For example, you can specify the duration of each frame, the easing function used to transition between frames, and whether to start the animation from the current frame or from the beginning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBefore you start making animated graphs, you should first ask yourself: Does it makes sense to go through the effort? If you are conducting an exploratory data analysis, a animated graphic may not be worth the time investment. However, if you are giving a presentation, a few well-placed animated graphics can help an audience connect with your topic remarkably better than static counterparts."

Using read_csv of readr package, import Exam_data.csv into R.\nThe code chunk below read_csv of readr package is used to import Exam_data.csv data file into R and save it as an tibble data frame called exam_data.\n\nexam_data &lt;- read_csv(\"../data/Exam_data.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nggiraph  is an htmlwidget and a ggplot2 extension. It allows ggplot graphics to be interactive.\nInteractive is made with ggplot geometries that can understand three arguments:\n\nTooltip a column of data-sets that contain tooltips to be displayed when the mouse is over elements.\nOnclick a column of data-sets that contain a JavaScript function to be executed when elements are clicked.\nData_id a column of data-sets that contain an id to be associated with elements.\n\nIf it used within a shiny application, elements associated with an id (data_id) can be selected and manipulated on client and server sides. Refer to this article for more detail explanation.\n\n\nBelow shows a typical code chunk to plot an interactive statistical graph by using ggiraph package. Notice that the code chunk consists of two parts. First, an ggplot object will be created. Next, girafe() of ggiraph will be used to create an interactive svg object.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = ID),\n    stackgroups = TRUE, \n    binwidth = 1, \n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL, \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 6*0.618\n)\n\nNotice that two steps are involved. First, an interactive version of ggplot2 geom (i.e. geom_dotplot_interactive) will be used to create the basic graph. Then, girafe will be used to generate an svg object to be displayed on an html page.\n\n\n\n\nBy hovering the mouse pointer on an data point of interest, the student’s ID will be displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of the tooltip can be customised by including a list object as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nexam_data$tooltip &lt;- c(paste0(     \n  \"Name = \", exam_data$ID,         \n  \"\\n Class = \", exam_data$CLASS)) \n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = exam_data$tooltip), \n    stackgroups = TRUE,\n    binwidth = 1,\n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 8,\n  height_svg = 8*0.618\n)\n\nThe first three lines of codes in the code chunk create a new field called tooltip. At the same time, it populates text in ID and CLASS fields into the newly created field.

Different from other plotly platform, plot.R is free and open source.\n\nThere are two ways to create interactive graph by using plotly, they are:\n\nby using plot_ly(), and\nby using ggplotly()\n\n\n\nThe tabset below shows an example a basic interactive plot created by using plot_ly().\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot_ly(data = exam_data, \n             x = ~MATHS, \n             y = ~ENGLISH)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, color argument is mapped to a qualitative visual variable (i.e. RACE).\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive:\n\nClick on the colour symbol at the legend.\n\n\n\n\nplot_ly(data = exam_data, \n             x = ~MATHS, \n             y = ~ENGLISH,\n             color = ~RACE)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below plots an interactive scatter plot by using ggplotly().\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n            aes(x = MATHS,\n                y = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\nggplotly(p)\n\n\n)\n\nNotice that the only extra line you need to include in the code chunk is ggplotly().\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe creation of a coordinated linked plot by using plotly involves three steps:\n\nhighlight_key() of plotly package is used as shared data.\ntwo scatterplots will be created by using ggplot2 functions.\nlastly, subplot() of plotly package is used to place them next to each other side-by-side.\n\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on a data point of one of the scatterplot and see how the corresponding point on the other scatterplot is selected.\n\n\n\nd &lt;- highlight_key(exam_data)\np1 &lt;- ggplot(data=d, \n            aes(x = MATHS,\n                y = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(data=d, \n            aes(x = MATHS,\n                y = SCIENCE)) +\n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\nsubplot(ggplotly(p1),\n        ggplotly(p2))\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk:\n\nhighlight_key() simply creates an object of class crosstalk::SharedData.\nVisit this link to learn more about crosstalk.\n\n\n\n\n\nCrosstalk is an add-on to the htmlwidgets package. It extends htmlwidgets with a set of classes, functions, and conventions for implementing cross-widget interactions (currently, linked brushing and filtering).\n\n\n\nA wrapper of the JavaScript Library DataTables\nData objects in R can be rendered as HTML tables using the JavaScript library ‘DataTables’ (typically via R Markdown or Shiny).\n\n\nDT::datatable(exam_data, class= \"compact\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on a data point of one of the scatterplot and see how the corresponding point on the other scatterplot is selected.\n\n\nCode chunk below is used to implement the coordinated brushing shown above.\n\nd &lt;- highlight_key(exam_data) \np &lt;- ggplot(d, \n            aes(ENGLISH, \n                MATHS)) + \n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\n\ngg &lt;- highlight(ggplotly(p),        \n                \"plotly_selected\")  \n\ncrosstalk::bscols(gg,               \n                  DT::datatable(d), \n                  widths = 5)        \n\n)\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk:\n\nhighlight() is a function of plotly package. It sets a variety of options for brushing (i.e., highlighting) multiple plots. These options are primarily designed for linking multiple plotly graphs, and may not behave as expected when linking plotly to another htmlwidget package via crosstalk. In some cases, other htmlwidgets will respect these options, such as persistent selection in leaflet.\nbscols() is a helper function of crosstalk package. It makes it easy to put HTML elements side by side. It can be called directly from the console but is especially designed to work in an R Markdown document.

    "text": "Correlation coefficient is a popular statistic that use to measure the type and strength of the relationship between two variables. The values of a correlation coefficient ranges between -1.0 and 1.0. A correlation coefficient of 1 shows a perfect linear relationship between the two variables, while a -1.0 shows a perfect inverse relationship between the two variables. A correlation coefficient of 0.0 shows no linear relationship between the two variables.\nWhen multivariate data are used, the correlation coefficeints of the pair comparisons are displayed in a table form known as correlation matrix or scatterplot matrix.\nThere are three broad reasons for computing a correlation matrix.\n\nTo reveal the relationship between high-dimensional variables pair-wisely.\nTo input into other analyses. For example, people commonly use correlation matrices as inputs for exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation models, and linear regression when excluding missing values pairwise.\nAs a diagnostic when checking other analyses. For example, with linear regression a high amount of correlations suggests that the linear regression’s estimates will be unreliable.\n\nWhen the data is large, both in terms of the number of observations and the number of variables, Corrgram tend to be used to visually explore and analyse the structure and the patterns of relations among variables. It is designed based on two main schemes:\n\nRendering the value of a correlation to depict its sign and magnitude, and\nReordering the variables in a correlation matrix so that “similar” variables are positioned adjacently, facilitating perception.\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to plot data visualisation for visualising correlation matrix with R. It consists of three main sections. First, you will learn how to create correlation matrix using pairs() of R Graphics. Next, you will learn how to plot corrgram using corrplot package of R. Lastly, you will learn how to create an interactive correlation matrix using plotly R.\n\n\n\nBefore you get started, you are required to open a new Quarto document. Keep the default html authoring format.\nNext, you will use the code chunk below to install and launch corrplot, ggpubr, plotly and tidyverse in RStudio.\n\npacman::p_load(corrplot, ggstatsplot, tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, the Wine Quality Data Set of UCI Machine Learning Repository will be used. The data set consists of 13 variables and 6497 observations. For the purpose of this exercise, we have combined the red wine and white wine data into one data file. It is called wine_quality and is in csv file format.\n\n\nFirst, let us import the data into R by using read_csv() of readr package.\n\nwine &lt;- read_csv(\"../data/wine_quality.csv\")\n\nNotice that beside quality and type, the rest of the variables are numerical and continuous data type.\n\n\n\n\nThere are more than one way to build scatterplot matrix with R. In this section, you will learn how to create a scatterplot matrix by using the pairs function of R Graphics.\nBefore you continue to the next step, you should read the syntax description of pairsfunction.\n\n\nFigure below shows the scatter plot matrix of Wine Quality Data. It is a 11 by 11 matrix.\n\npairs(wine[,1:11])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe required input of pairs() can be a matrix or data frame. The code chunk used to create the scatterplot matrix is relatively simple. It uses the default pairs function. Columns 2 to 12 of wine dataframe is used to build the scatterplot matrix. The variables are: fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates and alcohol.\n\npairs(wine[,2:12])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npairs function of R Graphics provided many customisation arguments. For example, it is a common practice to show either the upper half or lower half of the correlation matrix instead of both. This is because a correlation matrix is symmetric.\nTo show the lower half of the correlation matrix, the upper.panel argument will be used as shown in the code chunk below.\n\npairs(wine[,2:12], upper.panel = NULL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, you can display the upper half of the correlation matrix by using the code chun below.\n\npairs(wine[,2:12], lower.panel = NULL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo show the correlation coefficient of each pair of variables instead of a scatter plot, panel.cor function will be used. This will also show higher correlations in a larger font.\nDon’t worry about the details for now-just type this code into your R session or script.

The list should avoid any of the following arguments since they are already internally being used: corr, method, p.mat, sig.level, ggtheme, colors, lab, pch, legend.title, digits.\n\nThe sample sub-code chunk can be used to control specific component of the plot such as the font size of the x-axis, y-axis, and the statistical report.\n\nggplot.component = list(\n    theme(text=element_text(size=5),\n      axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8),\n      axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8)))\n\n\n\n\n\nSince ggstasplot is an extension of ggplot2, it also supports faceting. However the feature is not available in ggcorrmat() but in the grouped_ggcorrmat() of ggstatsplot.\n\ngrouped_ggcorrmat(\n  data = wine,\n  cor.vars = 1:11,\n  grouping.var = type,\n  type = \"robust\",\n  p.adjust.method = \"holm\",\n  plotgrid.args = list(ncol = 2),\n  ggcorrplot.args = list(outline.color = \"black\", \n                         hc.order = TRUE,\n                         tl.cex = 10),\n  annotation.args = list(\n    tag_levels = \"a\",\n    title = \"Correlogram for wine dataset\",\n    subtitle = \"The measures are: alcohol, sulphates, fixed acidity, citric acid, chlorides, residual sugar, density, free sulfur dioxide and volatile acidity\",\n    caption = \"Dataset: UCI Machine Learning Repository\"\n  )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nto build a facet plot, the only argument needed is grouping.var.\nBehind group_ggcorrmat(), patchwork package is used to create the multiplot. plotgrid.args argument provides a list of additional arguments passed to patchwork::wrap_plots, except for guides argument which is already separately specified earlier.\nLikewise, annotation.args argument is calling plot annotation arguments of patchwork package.\n\n\n\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, we will focus on corrplot. However, you are encouraged to explore the other two packages too.\nBefore getting started, you are required to read An Introduction to corrplot Package in order to gain basic understanding of corrplot package.\n\n\nBefore we can plot a corrgram using corrplot(), we need to compute the correlation matrix of wine data frame.\nIn the code chunk below, cor() of R Stats is used to compute the correlation matrix of wine data frame.\n\nwine.cor &lt;- cor(wine[, 1:11])\n\nNext, corrplot() is used to plot the corrgram by using all the default setting as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the default visual object used to plot the corrgram is circle. The default layout of the corrgram is a symmetric matrix. The default colour scheme is diverging blue-red. Blue colours are used to represent pair variables with positive correlation coefficients and red colours are used to represent pair variables with negative correlation coefficients. The intensity of the colour or also know as saturation is used to represent the strength of the correlation coefficient. Darker colours indicate relatively stronger linear relationship between the paired variables. On the other hand, lighter colours indicates relatively weaker linear relationship.\n\n\n\nIn corrplot package, there are seven visual geometrics (parameter method) can be used to encode the attribute values. They are: circle, square, ellipse, number, shade, color and pie. The default is circle. As shown in the previous section, the default visual geometric of corrplot matrix is circle. However, this default setting can be changed by using the method argument as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeel free to change the method argument to other supported visual geometrics.\n\n\n\ncorrplor() supports three layout types, namely: “full”, “upper” or “lower”. The default is “full” which display full matrix. The default setting can be changed by using the type argument of corrplot().\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         type=\"lower\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default layout of the corrgram can be further customised. For example, arguments diag and tl.col are used to turn off the diagonal cells and to change the axis text label colour to black colour respectively as shown in the code chunk and figure below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         type=\"lower\",\n         diag = FALSE,\n         tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease feel free to experiment with other layout design argument such as tl.pos, tl.cex, tl.offset, cl.pos, cl.cex and cl.offset, just to mention a few of them.\n\n\n\nWith corrplot package, it is possible to design corrgram with mixed visual matrix of one half and numerical matrix on the other half. In order to create a coorgram with mixed layout, the corrplot.mixed(), a wrapped function for mixed visualisation style will be used.\nFigure below shows a mixed layout corrgram plotted using wine quality data.\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk used to plot the corrgram are shown below.\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that argument lower and upper are used to define the visualisation method used. In this case ellipse is used to map the lower half of the corrgram and numerical matrix (i.e. number) is used to map the upper half of the corrgram. The argument tl.pos, on the other, is used to specify the placement of the axis label. Lastly, the diag argument is used to specify the glyph on the principal diagonal of the corrgram.\n\n\n\nIn statistical analysis, we are also interested to know which pair of variables their correlation coefficients are statistically significant.\nFigure below shows a corrgram combined with the significant test. The corrgram reveals that not all correlation pairs are statistically significant. For example the correlation between total sulfur dioxide and free surfur dioxide is statistically significant at significant level of 0.1 but not the pair between total sulfur dioxide and citric acid.\n\nWith corrplot package, we can use the cor.mtest() to compute the p-values and confidence interval for each pair of variables.\n\nwine.sig = cor.mtest(wine.cor, conf.level= .95)\n\nWe can then use the p.mat argument of corrplot function as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor,\n         method = \"number\",\n         type = \"lower\",\n         diag = FALSE,\n         tl.col = \"black\",\n         tl.srt = 45,\n         p.mat = wine.sig$p,\n         sig.level = .05)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatrix reorder is very important for mining the hiden structure and pattern in a corrgram. By default, the order of attributes of a corrgram is sorted according to the correlation matrix (i.e. “original”). The default setting can be over-write by using the order argument of corrplot(). Currently, corrplot package support four sorting methods, they are:\n\n“AOE” is for the angular order of the eigenvectors. See Michael Friendly (2002) for details.\n“FPC” for the first principal component order.\n“hclust” for hierarchical clustering order, and “hclust.method” for the agglomeration method to be used.\n“hclust.method” should be one of “ward”, “single”, “complete”, “average”, “mcquitty”, “median” or “centroid”.\n“alphabet” for alphabetical order.\n\n“AOE”, “FPC”, “hclust”, “alphabet”. More algorithms can be found in seriation package.\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               order=\"AOE\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf using hclust, corrplot() can draw rectangles around the corrgram based on the results of hierarchical clustering.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         tl.pos = \"lt\",\n         tl.col = \"black\",\n         order=\"hclust\",\n         hclust.method = \"ward.D\",\n         addrect = 3)"

    "text": "Correlation coefficient is a popular statistic that use to measure the type and strength of the relationship between two variables. The values of a correlation coefficient ranges between -1.0 and 1.0. A correlation coefficient of 1 shows a perfect linear relationship between the two variables, while a -1.0 shows a perfect inverse relationship between the two variables. A correlation coefficient of 0.0 shows no linear relationship between the two variables.\nWhen multivariate data are used, the correlation coefficeints of the pair comparisons are displayed in a table form known as correlation matrix or scatterplot matrix.\nThere are three broad reasons for computing a correlation matrix.\n\nTo reveal the relationship between high-dimensional variables pair-wisely.\nTo input into other analyses. For example, people commonly use correlation matrices as inputs for exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation models, and linear regression when excluding missing values pairwise.\nAs a diagnostic when checking other analyses. For example, with linear regression a high amount of correlations suggests that the linear regression’s estimates will be unreliable.\n\nWhen the data is large, both in terms of the number of observations and the number of variables, Corrgram tend to be used to visually explore and analyse the structure and the patterns of relations among variables. It is designed based on two main schemes:\n\nRendering the value of a correlation to depict its sign and magnitude, and\nReordering the variables in a correlation matrix so that “similar” variables are positioned adjacently, facilitating perception.\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to plot data visualisation for visualising correlation matrix with R. It consists of three main sections. First, you will learn how to create correlation matrix using pairs() of R Graphics. Next, you will learn how to plot corrgram using corrplot package of R. Lastly, you will learn how to create an interactive correlation matrix using plotly R."

For example the correlation between total sulfur dioxide and free surfur dioxide is statistically significant at significant level of 0.1 but not the pair between total sulfur dioxide and citric acid.\n\nWith corrplot package, we can use the cor.mtest() to compute the p-values and confidence interval for each pair of variables.\n\nwine.sig = cor.mtest(wine.cor, conf.level= .95)\n\nWe can then use the p.mat argument of corrplot function as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor,\n         method = \"number\",\n         type = \"lower\",\n         diag = FALSE,\n         tl.col = \"black\",\n         tl.srt = 45,\n         p.mat = wine.sig$p,\n         sig.level = .05)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatrix reorder is very important for mining the hiden structure and pattern in a corrgram. By default, the order of attributes of a corrgram is sorted according to the correlation matrix (i.e. “original”). The default setting can be over-write by using the order argument of corrplot(). Currently, corrplot package support four sorting methods, they are:\n\n“AOE” is for the angular order of the eigenvectors. See Michael Friendly (2002) for details.\n“FPC” for the first principal component order.\n“hclust” for hierarchical clustering order, and “hclust.method” for the agglomeration method to be used.\n“hclust.method” should be one of “ward”, “single”, “complete”, “average”, “mcquitty”, “median” or “centroid”.\n“alphabet” for alphabetical order.\n\n“AOE”, “FPC”, “hclust”, “alphabet”. More algorithms can be found in seriation package.\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               order=\"AOE\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf using hclust, corrplot() can draw rectangles around the corrgram based on the results of hierarchical clustering.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         tl.pos = \"lt\",\n         tl.col = \"black\",\n         order=\"hclust\",\n         hclust.method = \"ward.D\",\n         addrect = 3)"

    "text": "Parallel coordinates plot is a data visualisation specially designed for visualising and analysing multivariate, numerical data. It is ideal for comparing multiple variables together and seeing the relationships between them. For example, the variables contribute to Happiness Index. Parallel coordinates was invented by Alfred Inselberg in the 1970s as a way to visualize high-dimensional data. This data visualisation technique is more often found in academic and scientific communities than in business and consumer data visualizations. As pointed out by Stephen Few(2006), “This certainly isn’t a chart that you would present to the board of directors or place on your Web site for the general public. In fact, the strength of parallel coordinates isn’t in their ability to communicate some truth in the data to others, but rather in their ability to bring meaningful multivariate patterns and comparisons to light when used interactively for analysis.” For example, parallel coordinates plot can be used to characterise clusters detected during customer segmentation.\nBy the end of this hands-on exercise, you will gain hands-on experience on:\n\nplotting statistic parallel coordinates plots by using ggparcoord() of GGally package,\nplotting interactive parallel coordinates plots by using parcoords package, and\nplotting interactive parallel coordinates plots by using parallelPlot package.\n\n\n\n\nFor this exercise, the GGally, parcoords, parallelPlot and tidyverse packages will be used.\nThe code chunks below are used to install and load the packages in R.\n\npacman::p_load(GGally, parallelPlot, tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, the World Happinees 2018 (http://worldhappiness.report/ed/2018/) data will be used.

    "text": "Ternary plots are a way of displaying the distribution and variability of three-part compositional data. (For example, the proportion of aged, economy active and young population or sand, silt, and clay in soil.) It’s display is a triangle with sides scaled from 0 to 1. Each side represents one of the three components. A point is plotted so that a line drawn perpendicular from the point to each leg of the triangle intersect at the component values of the point.\nIn this hands-on, you will learn how to build ternary plot programmatically using R for visualising and analysing population structure of Singapore.\nThe hands-on exercise consists of four steps:\n\nInstall and launch tidyverse and ggtern packages.\nDerive three new measures using mutate() function of dplyr package.\nBuild a static ternary plot using ggtern() function of ggtern package.\nBuild an interactive ternary plot using plot-ly() function of Plotly R package.\n\n\n\n\nFor this exercise, two main R packages will be used in this hands-on exercise, they are:\n\nggtern, a ggplot extension specially designed to plot ternary diagrams. The package will be used to plot static ternary plots.\nPlotly R, an R package for creating interactive web-based graphs via plotly’s JavaScript graphing library, plotly.js . The plotly R libary contains the ggplotly function, which will convert ggplot2 figures into a Plotly object.\n\nWe will also need to ensure that selected tidyverse family packages namely: readr, dplyr and tidyr are also installed and loaded.\nIn this exercise, version 3.2.1 of ggplot2 will be installed instead of the latest version of ggplot2.

    "text": "Ternary plots are a way of displaying the distribution and variability of three-part compositional data. (For example, the proportion of aged, economy active and young population or sand, silt, and clay in soil.) It’s display is a triangle with sides scaled from 0 to 1. Each side represents one of the three components. A point is plotted so that a line drawn perpendicular from the point to each leg of the triangle intersect at the component values of the point.\nIn this hands-on, you will learn how to build ternary plot programmatically using R for visualising and analysing population structure of Singapore.\nThe hands-on exercise consists of four steps:\n\nInstall and launch tidyverse and ggtern packages.\nDerive three new measures using mutate() function of dplyr package.\nBuild a static ternary plot using ggtern() function of ggtern package.\nBuild an interactive ternary plot using plot-ly() function of Plotly R package."
