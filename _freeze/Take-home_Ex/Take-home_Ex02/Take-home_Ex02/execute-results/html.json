This analysis explores Singapore’s international trade trends by examining Merchandise Trade by Region/Market data from the Department of Statistics Singapore (DOS).\n\nThe objectives of this study are as follows:\n\n1.  Critique & Improve Trade Visualizations – Analyze three existing trade-related visualizations, assess their strengths and weaknesses, and propose enhanced designs.\n\n2.  Develop Data-Driven Visual Insights – Utilize R and ggplot2 to recreate the selected visualizations, ensuring a more effective presentation of trade patterns.\n\n3.  Perform Time-Series Analysis – Apply statistical methods to identify trade trends and forecast future movements using time-series models.\n\nThis study enhances the clarity and effectiveness of trade data visualization, leveraging data analytics techniques to uncover meaningful patterns in Singapore’s international trade.\n\n# Download and Prepare the Data\n\n## Load Library using Pacman\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(tidyverse, \n               ggplot2, \n               skimr,  # For data summary \n               janitor, # For cleaning column names\n               SmartEDA,\n               easystats,\n               gtsummary,\n               ggstatsplot,\n               knitr,\n               kableExtra,\n               patchwork,\n               GGally,\n               ggridges,\n               lubridate,\n               scales)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Load and Inspect Data\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nship_data <- read.csv(\"data/Ship_Performance_Dataset.csv\")\n```\n:::\n",
